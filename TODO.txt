- delete a reservation, only if the book is in RESERVED status
- in case of /reserve (reservation, and not checkout), we have to check the wishedEndDate to ensure that there is no overlap
- write tests on RESERVED and ONLOAN status
- allow reservation of a book even if it is already reserved and if the dates of the booking are not overlapping




BEST PRACTISES:
- for a post endpoint what to put as input dto ? For the book, do we put the author id or the complete object to search
and eventually create ?
