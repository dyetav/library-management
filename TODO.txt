- delete a reservation, only if the book is in RESERVED status
- create and manage the RESERVED status (Availability)
- it should be possible to reserve a book for a different start date
- probably it is possible to call /reserve to push the status to RESERVED and /checkout to push the status to ONLOAN (the
customer takes the book with him)
- write tests on RESERVED and ONLOAN status
